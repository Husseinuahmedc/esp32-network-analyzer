#ESP32 Network Analyzer Tool  
Advanced Wi-Fi Scanning, Visualization & Security Insight

This project delivers a practical Network Analyzer built on ESP32, providing real-time scanning of nearby Wi-Fi networks, extracting key metadata (RSSI, Channels, Security Type), and streaming the results into a live web dashboard with charts and structured documentation.

---

##Core Features

###Real-Time Wi-Fi Scanning
- SSID  
- BSSID (MAC Address)  
- RSSI (Signal Strength)  
- Channel  
- Frequency Band  
- Security Type (Open, WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3)

### OLED Display Status
- IP Address  
- Connection State  
- Scan Progress  
- Network Count  

### Web Dashboard
- Real-time charts (RSSI strength, channel distribution)
- Dynamic table  
- Responsive UI (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

###Documentation Page
- Security definitions  
- Channel theory  
- Explanation of dashboard charts

##Dashboard Insights

### RSSI Chart

Strength level of detected networks.

### Channel Distribution

Shows congestion and interference.

### Security Classification

| Security   | Meaning           | Risk   |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| Open       | No encryption     | High   |
| WPA / WPA2 | Protected         | Medium |
| WPA3       | Modern encryption | Low    |

---

## Problem Solved

* Identifies congested Wi-Fi channels
* Analyzes network security levels
* Portable hardware-based analyzer
* Real-time visualization without external servers

---

## Future Upgrades

* 5 GHz scanning
* Handshake capture
* Heat-map visualization
* Export reports (JSON / CSV)
* Mobile-optimized UI
